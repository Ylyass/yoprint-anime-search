Make it proper shape, and the name of each anime, write it nicely, not connected to the image. And the scrolling as well, and make the sizes of anime images a bit smaller, so more can fit -add option without searching just to see popular animes, make small research on which top 20 animes, and list them down, when u scroll down the home page. The home page u have to make more wow effect, maybe more features, or more neon colors, or some shape. -when u resize the web page, the search but doesn't resize smoothly, it starts to overlay Look at the screenshots, write the improvements in paragraphs

------------Output for Prompt 2----------- 
Here’s how you can improve your current Anime Search App UI (based on the screenshots and your notes) — in paragraph form, focusing on visual polish, interaction, and futuristic detail while keeping everything cohesive and responsive:

The overall futuristic neon concept is already strong, but the layout can be refined to make the app feel more premium and polished. First, fix the empty state so that when there are no search results, a clear, friendly message appears in the center — something like “No results found for your search. Try one of these popular anime titles!” followed by interactive, glowing pill buttons for quick searches such as Naruto, Bleach, or Spy × Family. Add a small animated mascot illustration or floating particles to keep it visually alive even when the screen is empty.

Next, adjust the search bar positioning. The text “SEARCH ANIME” currently overlaps with the glass border — reduce its font size slightly, add top padding, or move it above the border as a floating label. The “/” icon at the end can be replaced with a more intuitive feature — for example, show a blinking cursor light or a “search instantly” indicator. If you want it to have meaning, use it to represent a keyboard shortcut hint (like / or Ctrl + K) to focus on the search bar, but it should have a tooltip explaining that.

The header (“ANIME SEARCH”) should either act as a clickable home button or lose the hover effect. Right now, it misleads users into thinking it’s interactive, so link it back to the home page or remove the hover pointer. For the home page itself, enhance the visual depth by adding softly glowing abstract shapes, subtle gridlines, or animated streaks of light moving behind the search section — almost like a sci-fi dashboard background. Include a “Top 20 Popular Anime” section beneath the search bar, using a horizontal neon carousel with hover scaling and soft motion glow to make it look alive. You can populate it with trending titles like One Piece, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, and Jujutsu Kaisen.

Improve the anime results layout by switching from the current oval crop to a clean rectangular or slightly rounded card style. Each card should show the anime poster clearly, with the title displayed below on a translucent glass strip instead of overlapping the image. Maintain consistent image ratios (e.g., 3:4) and shrink them slightly so more fit per row without scrolling too much. When hovering, add a subtle 3D tilt and glowing border to give that “holographic gallery” impression.

For responsiveness, make sure the search bar and card grid resize gracefully — avoid overlapping by using flex or grid layouts with responsive breakpoints. The search bar should shrink smoothly while keeping inner padding consistent, and all glowing outlines should adapt dynamically. You can also enhance transitions: make the search bar expand when focused, dim the background slightly, and show a short tagline like “Find your next favorite anime” below it to add emotion and identity.

Finally, unify everything with motion and glow consistency — neon colors (cyan, magenta, violet gradients) should softly animate in the background or border strokes, but never overpower text readability. Consider small touches like a floating particle field behind the content, glowing section dividers, or pulsing buttons on hover. With these refinements, your UI will feel like a sleek, glassy anime discovery interface straight out of a futuristic OS — beautiful, responsive, and immersive.

I use Chatgbt and Cursor, I mix up Normal, Thinking, Extended Thinking, Agent modes to get the best outcome.
I write prompt what type of design i want to see, i ask chatgbt to give me improved ideas, to refer to top existing app, make something unique ethereal, and the output i paste to cursor agent. Then i start making fixed by looking at the Web UI
With magificent power of AI, i can manage completing any task, as long as u know the how to communicate with it, and get the most use of it.
The task completion took 4-5 hour.
